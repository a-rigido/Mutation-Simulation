# Mutation-Simulation
# Alex Rigido
A small project using bioinformatic tools in R (3.6.1) to analyse point mutation in oncogenes. Oncogenes are define as genes that are prone to transform a cell into a cancerous cell via the slightest mutation. This script analyses the probability that a random point mutation in the three selected oncogenes (KRas, OR1A1, and PTPN11) will result in a mutation that can potentially transform the cell into a cancerous one. Below gives a brief summary of the genes.

The KRas gene gives functionality to the GTPase K-Ras which plays a major role in the RAS/MAPK pathway of a cell. This pathway play important roles in apoptosis, cell division, and cell differentiation. OR1A1 is a protein coding gene that plays an important role in pathways for peptide ligand-binding receptors and signaling by GPCR. The PTPN11 gene codes for a protein called SHP-2, and this protein helps regulate the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway.
